# YanPes Ideavim Config
Although I am a strong beliver in the developer eperience, pure speed and immersion of Neovim, I find myself switching to JetBrains IntelliJ a lot during my paid job. It is a great software package with extremely powerful functionality. In addition, my enterprise environment makes it a pure pain to get all features and plugins running, so the cool jazz of Neovim is stripped away unfortunately. #zeroTrustPolicy #securityKillsDevs

Therefore, I decided to live in two worlds at the same time by activating the `idea-vim` plugin for JetBrains products. By default it only supports very basic vim motions. Really cool to get rolling and pump out code fast but the lack of custom key-bindings is super annoying if you are familiar with your beloved lua configs.

Fortunately, the `idea-vim` plugin provides a solution! You can use a `.ideavimrc` file in your home directory to unleash the power of customization bliss to your IDE.

This repository contains my `.ideavimrc` config file to add missing shortcut functionality to my IdeaVim experience!
